<h1>How Govmind Works</h1>
<p>Govmind is a hub for machine learning applications on goverment-based data. These applications include anomaly detection, classification, computer vision analysis, and other cases that can help public servants make smarter decisions.  </p>
<p>Models are aggregated from separate organizations including  <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/">Microsoft</a>, and deep learning with <a href="http://www.ersatzlabs.com/">Ersatz Labs</a>. Public problems are addressed through a robust feedback loop between public servants, data scientists, and developers. Public servants generate the data. Data scientists study the data and produce the models. And, developers link the APIs from said AI platforms to a user friendly interface back for use by public servants. </p>
